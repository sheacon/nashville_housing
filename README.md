# Nashville Real Estate

House prices are a common project topic for data sciece learning. I've attempted to make this more interesting by collecting my own real-world data. This is a data collection and exploratory data analysis project for an academic course that I've since expanded with predictive modeling.

## Data Collection and Preparation
-  [Web scraping](https://github.com/sheacon/nashville_real_estate/blob/main/scrape.md)
-  [Cleaning](https://github.com/sheacon/nashville_real_estate/blob/main/data/2_cleaned/clean_data.Rmd)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Understand data, visualize trends, and identify potential features
- [Brief EDA Presentation](brief_presentation.pdf)
- [Full EDA Report](final_report.pdf)

## Modeling
- How accurately can prices be predicted with these features?
- [Modeling Results](https://github.com/sheacon/nashville_real_estate/blob/main/modeling/modeling.md)
