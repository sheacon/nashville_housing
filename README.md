# Nashville Real Estate

House prices are a common project topic for data science learners. I've attempted to make this more interesting by collecting my own real-world data for my current city.
- Local data was collected from Zillow using a custom scraper. Includes richer features than Kaggle datasets.
- Extensive cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis was performed
- Linear, tree-based, and novel transformer models have been applied and compared for price prediction
